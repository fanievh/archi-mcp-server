# Archi MCP Server

An Eclipse PDE plugin for [Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/) that exposes ArchiMate models through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), enabling LLMs to query, analyse, and modify enterprise architecture models through natural language.

## What It Does

Archi MCP Server embeds an HTTP server inside Archi that speaks MCP. Once running, any MCP-compatible LLM client (Claude, Cline, LM Studio, etc.) can connect and interact with the currently open ArchiMate model — asking questions, searching elements, traversing relationships, composing view diagrams, and even creating or modifying model content.

The server provides **51 MCP tools** across querying, searching, creating, layout, routing, assessment, batch operations, and more — plus **6 MCP resources** with ArchiMate reference material and workflow guides for LLMs.

**Example conversation:**

> **You:** "What applications support the Customer Portal capability?"
>
> **LLM:** Searches elements, traverses relationships, and returns: *"7 applications support Customer Portal: OrderService, PaymentGateway, ..."*

## Requirements

| Requirement | Version |
|---|---|
| [Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/) | 5.7+ |
| Java | 21+ |
| An MCP-compatible LLM client | Claude CLI, Cline, LM Studio, etc. |

**LLM model size recommendation:** 8B+ parameters minimum, 14B+ for reliable tool calling, 70B+ for complex view composition workflows.

## Installation

1. Download the latest `.archiplugin` from the [Releases](../../releases) page (or the `bin/` directory for pre-built artifacts)
2. In Archi: **Help > Manage Plug-ins > Install New...** or copy to Archi's `dropins/` folder
3. Restart Archi

## Getting Started

### 1. Start the Server

Open an ArchiMate model in Archi, then:

**Menu:** `MCP Server > Start MCP Server`

The menu toggles between Start/Stop. The default endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:18090`.

### 2. Configure Your LLM Client

#### Claude Code (CLI)

In your project's `.mcp.json` or `~/.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "archi": {
      "type": "url",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:18090/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cline / Other MCP Clients

Point your MCP client at the Streamable-HTTP endpoint:

```
http://127.0.0.1:18090/mcp
```

SSE transport is also available at `/sse` for older clients.

### 3. Start Querying

With the server running and your LLM client connected, you can ask questions in natural language:

- *"Give me an overview of this architecture model"*
- *"Find all Application Services in the model"*
- *"What does the Order Processing component depend on?"*
- *"Show me the relationships between the CRM and ERP systems"*
- *"Create a new view showing the payment processing flow"*
- *"Auto-layout and route the connections on this view"*

## Configuration

Access via **Window > Preferences > MCP Server** in Archi.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Port** | `18090` | HTTP(S) server port |
| **Bind Address** | `127.0.0.1` | Network interface (localhost only by default) |
| **Auto-Start** | `false` | Start the server automatically when Archi launches |
| **Log Level** | `INFO` | Logging verbosity: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR` |
| **Enable TLS** | `false` | Use HTTPS with TLS encryption |
| **Keystore File** | *(empty)* | Path to PKCS12/JKS keystore (auto-generated if using self-signed) |
| **Keystore Password** | *(empty)* | Password for the keystore file |

### TLS / HTTPS

The server supports optional TLS encryption. To enable:

1. In preferences, check **Enable TLS (HTTPS)**
2. Click **Generate Self-Signed Certificate** to create a keystore automatically
3. Restart the server — the endpoint changes to `https://127.0.0.1:18090`

Clients must trust the self-signed certificate. For `curl` testing, use the `-k` flag. For LLM clients, import the certificate into the client's trust store or the JVM `cacerts`.

## MCP Resources

The server provides 6 reference resources accessible to LLM clients.

### Prompts

| URI | Description |
|---|---|
| `archimate://prompts/model-exploration-guide` | Strategy guide for LLMs on how to efficiently search and traverse ArchiMate models |
| `archimate://prompts/explore-dependencies` | Workflow template for systematic dependency analysis of ArchiMate elements |
| `archimate://prompts/landscape-overview` | Workflow template for generating architecture landscape summaries |

### References

| URI | Description |
|---|---|
| `archimate://reference/archimate-layers` | Comprehensive mapping of ArchiMate layers to element types with descriptions |
| `archimate://reference/archimate-relationships` | All ArchiMate relationship types with valid source/target combinations and usage guidance |
| `archimate://reference/archimate-view-patterns` | Curated viewpoint patterns, layout algorithm guidance, and diagramming best practices for composing ArchiMate views |

## Mutation Safety

All write operations integrate with Archi's **CommandStack**, making every mutation **undoable** via `Ctrl+Z` in Archi or the `undo` / `redo` tools.

**Approval mode** adds a human-in-the-loop gate:

```
set-approval-mode(true)
  → LLM proposes mutations → they queue as "pending"
  → list-pending-approvals → review what's proposed
  → decide-mutation(id, "approve") → apply, or "reject" → discard
```

**Batch mode** groups mutations into atomic transactions:

```
begin-batch()
  → create-element(...)
  → create-relationship(...)
  → add-to-view(...)
end-batch()
  → All succeed together or all roll back
```

## Troubleshooting

**Server won't start**
- Check if port 18090 is already in use: `lsof -i :18090`
- Verify the bind address in preferences is valid

**LLM client can't connect**
- Confirm the server is running (menu shows "Stop MCP Server")
- Verify the port matches your client config
- Test connectivity: `curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18090/mcp -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0"}}}'`

**Model appears empty**
- Ensure an ArchiMate model is open in Archi before connecting
- If the model was opened after the session started, reconnect the LLM client

**Mutations fail with validation error**
- Check the `archiMateReference` field in the error — it cites the relevant ArchiMate spec section
- Use `search-and-create` instead of `create-element` to avoid duplicates

**TLS connection issues**
- Verify the keystore file exists and the password is correct
- For self-signed certificates, ensure the client trusts the certificate or use `-k` with `curl`

## Architecture Layers

The codebase enforces strict layer boundaries to keep concerns separated:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 1 — Protocol          server/, registry/     │
│  Only MCP SDK + Jetty types. No EMF imports.        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 2 — Handlers          handlers/              │
│  DTOs + ArchiModelAccessor interface only.           │
│  No EMF or SWT imports.                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 3 — Model             model/                 │
│  ONLY package that imports EMF / ArchimateTool.     │
│  Returns DTOs, never EObjects.                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 4 — UI                ui/                    │
│  SWT/Eclipse UI only. Preferences, menus, status.   │
│  Never blocks Jetty threads.                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key rule:** Handlers never see EMF objects. All model access goes through the `ArchiModelAccessor` interface, which returns DTOs.

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Transport

- **Dual transport:** Streamable-HTTP (`/mcp`) + SSE (`/sse`) for backward compatibility
- Each transport gets its own `McpSyncServer` instance
- `HttpServletStreamableServerTransportProvider` and `HttpServletSseServerTransportProvider` both extend `HttpServlet`

### Threading

- **Reads:** Direct EMF access from Jetty threads (thread-safe for read-only)
- **Mutations:** Dispatched to the SWT UI thread via `Display.syncExec()` for CommandStack consistency
- UI thread is never blocked by read operations

### Response Envelope

Every tool response follows a standard structure:

```json
{
  "result": { },
  "nextSteps": ["Use get-relationships to explore connections", "..."],
  "_meta": { "totalCount": 42, "isTruncated": false, "durationMs": 12 }
}
```

### Error Handling

Structured errors with actionable guidance:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Relationship type not valid between these elements",
    "details": "ServingRelationship requires ApplicationComponent as source",
    "suggestedCorrection": "Use an ApplicationComponent or change relationship type",
    "archiMateReference": "ArchiMate 3.2 § 5.1.2"
  }
}
```

### Mutation Pattern

All mutation tools use the `PreparedMutation<T>` pattern:
1. Validate inputs and build the command (on Jetty thread)
2. Dispatch execution to UI thread via `Display.syncExec()`
3. Execute through Archi's CommandStack (enables undo/redo)
4. Return result DTO

For connections, `redo()` must null-then-reconnect due to Archi's `connect()` early-return guard.

## Adding a New Tool

1. **Create or extend a handler** in `handlers/`
2. **Register the tool** in `registerTools()` — define the JSON schema, description, and call handler
3. **Add model access** if needed — new method on `ArchiModelAccessor` interface, implemented in `ArchiModelAccessorImpl` (returns DTOs, not EObjects)
4. **Format responses** using `ResponseFormatter` with the standard envelope
5. **Handle errors** — catch at the handler boundary, translate to structured `ErrorResponse`
6. **Write tests** — mock `ArchiModelAccessor` for handler tests (no EMF runtime needed)

## Testing

The test bundle (`net.vheerden.archi.mcp.tests`) is an OSGi fragment with `Fragment-Host: net.vheerden.archi.mcp`, giving it full access to main plugin classes.

- **Run tests** in Eclipse as "JUnit Plug-in Test", one class at a time
- **Pure-Java tests** (geometry, layout algorithms, routing) can also run as standard JUnit tests without the Eclipse runtime
- Handler tests mock `ArchiModelAccessor` — no Archi installation needed
- Tests needing Archi runtime (preferences, EMF model) require the full Eclipse environment

## PDE Build Notes

This is a pure Eclipse PDE project — no Maven or Gradle. Key files:

- `MANIFEST.MF` — OSGi bundle metadata, `Bundle-ClassPath` lists all JARs
- `build.properties` — PDE build includes
- `.classpath` — Eclipse project classpath

When adding a new JAR dependency, update **three places**: the `lib/` directory, `MANIFEST.MF` `Bundle-ClassPath`, and `.classpath`.
